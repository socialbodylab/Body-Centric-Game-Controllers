Workshop with Social Body Lab and Dames Making Games at the Toronto Media Arts Centre<br>

This workshop is part of our larger series on textile game controllers. It will focus on the use of a material called Velostat to create custom sensors that can be read and interpreted by an Arduino to create a bespoke interface for any keyboard-controlled game. This material can be squeezed, sat on, pressed, or stomped and cut into whatever size or shape is the best fit for your game!
